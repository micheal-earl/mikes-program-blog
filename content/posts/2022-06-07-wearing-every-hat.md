I'm learning that approaching software engineering from a professional perspective is requiring me to stretch myself in every direction. I have to understand every aspect of the process from dev ops to marketing.

I'm working with a good friend of mine and both of us have hammered in some of the systems/frameworks we'll be using going forward. Some of these were picked simply because they are popular industry standards. Others were picked because they felt comfortable.

For now we've been tackling the planning phase. Specifically, we've begun creating our product backlog via the scrum framework. In this backlog, we define every requirement we need to fulfill to reach our "product goal." That product goal is our end product. The website or application itself.

On a side note, git is a different beast when I'm not using it on my own for personal projects. I've even contributed to a few open source projects, but using git the "right" way will take some learning. But that's the whole point.
