I don't really know what to do. My knowledge is all over the place. I can tell you a _little_ bit about basically any web stack or language, but not enough to show true proficiency or capability. It is time to change my habits and really stick to something. I just have no idea what that something should be.

My real goal is to be a game developer. I want to make games from the ground up through code. Most of my development time has been spent on games, but I continuously change technologies and projects. The new plan is to just really stick with something until I feel that it can be put on my resume. If my accomplishments are something that I truly want to share with the world, then I'll be much happier with my progress.

So, now I have a decision to make. What technology should I be focusing on that will really show my potential? I will be playing around a little bit and, hopefully, I do not fall back into my old patterns.

Mike from the future: I did fall back into my old patterns. However, I think I was a little mistaken when this post was written. Spreading my skills throughout several "technologies" is not inherently a bad thing. The bad thing is not finishing projects that I start.
