Sorry I haven't been very active these past few weeks. I've been preparing myself to move back to the city. I'll finally have a decent internet connection again! I'm looking forward to getting all this moving stuff over with.

I originally wanted to write a post about event handlers in C#, but I've been too distracted. This is going to be a pretty short post.

I will be writing new posts in the future, so if anyone is actually reading this you can expect some content in the next week or so.
