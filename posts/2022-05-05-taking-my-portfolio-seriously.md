As I’m about to graduate with my bachelor’s degree in computer science, I’ve been thinking more and more about my journey up to this point.

Really, I’ve discovered that I have a lot less to show for it than I thought. Most of my work is broken up into fragmented minor projects or school work that I couldn’t _really_ apply passion to.

So what do I do? My solution is to treat the creation of my portfolio like a job. I expect to work on it certain hours each day and to make incremental progress for the next few months.

Writing here in my blog is just another aspect of my portfolio. I want to fully explore the software engineering process and record my thoughts as I go. I want to look back on these projects and _learn_ something from them even years from now.

That being said, I’m still brainstorming what will go in my portfolio. Scope is difficult for me to judge. I know that “GitHub for musicians” is massive in scope and that “Metacritic for recipes” is smaller. But how much smaller? Could I finish the latter in under a month and have a genuine product to show for it?

Only time will tell.
