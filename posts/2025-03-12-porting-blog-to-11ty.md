## Why?

I was using Hugo before 11ty and I remember being pretty happy with it. The problem is: once two
years have passed, I can't remember a whole lot about how the site was put together.

Additionally, Hugo has a bit _too_ many bells and whistles for me.

Enter 11ty. 11ty is very straightforward to use. I'm writing mostly my own html and css, and not
having to fiddle with things too much. Everything just sort of works and it stays simple

## How?

I just peeked at the 11ty docs and updated the repo that netlify pulls from to host my site. It was
actually pretty easy to do and netlify still works great.

## Design

I'm no incredible designer, but I really like the new look of the blog. Since I didn't have to
fiddle around with any templates, it was much easier to get things to look the way I wanted them to.
Everything is just plain old html/css.
